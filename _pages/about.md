I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Cognition and Action and the Memory, Action and Perception labs at the Centre for Neuroscience Studies at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario (Canada). I am orignially from Germany, where I obtained a B.Sc. in Physics and an M.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering both from RWTH Aachen University. I then joined the University of British Columbia in beautiful Vancouver (Canada) to work with Miriam Spering and Dinesh Pai. After some time in the Computer Science department (M.Sc. in 2015) I finally settled on Neuroscience and completed my Ph.D. in 2019. 

Research Interests
======
I am interested in eye and hand movement control during naturalistic tasks that require quick sensorimotor predictions and decisions. Making rapid and accurate predictions in dynamic enviornments is important to facilitate perception and action. For example, the ability to predict the trajectory of a pitched baseball critically determines successful performance of the hitter. In my research I study eye movements as continuous readouts of ongoing sensorimotor and cognitive processes. In particular, I investigate how eye movements contribute to decision processes, such as whether, when, and where to act. Moreover, I am interested in investigating the interplay between eye and hand movements at different stages of sensorimotor decisions. To study these processes I use state-of-the art head-fixed eye tracking combined with 3D hand movement tracking in the laboratory environment. 

Current Projects
======
I am currently investigating how eye and hand movements are coordinated in real-world actions in which there is competition for gaze.
