I am a postdoctoral fellow working with Randy Flanagan (Cognition & Action Lab) and Jason Gallivan (Memory, Action & Perception lab) at the Centre for Neuroscience Studies at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario (Canada). I am orignially from Germany, where I completed a B.Sc. in Physics and an M.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering both from RWTH Aachen University. I then joined the University of British Columbia in beautiful Vancouver (Canada) to work with Miriam Spering and Dinesh Pai. After some time in the Computer Science department (M.Sc. in 2015), I finally settled on a Ph.D. in Neuroscience and graduated in November 2019. 

Research Interests
======
I am interested in eye and hand movement control during naturalistic tasks that require quick sensorimotor predictions and decisions. During many goal-directed actions we continuously predict when and where we will interact with visual objects in our environment. In my research I study eye movements as continuous readouts of ongoing sensorimotor and cognitive processes. In particular, I study eye movements as indicators of decision processes, such as whether, when, and where to act. I am interested in understanding the underlying mechanisms of the interplay between eye and hand movements at different stages of sensorimotor decisions and how the two systems work in synergy during everyday tasks. To study these processes I use state-of-the art eye tracking combined with 3D hand movement tracking.
