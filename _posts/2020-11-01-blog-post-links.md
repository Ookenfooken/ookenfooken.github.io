Sex Differences are no Afterthought
======
Two of my lab mates and I recently stumbled across an article that reported a "male advantage" during visuomotor tracking. We saw several problems with the study and blogged about our thoughts on the UBC's Women's Health Blog. If you cringe at the term "male advantage" in a visuomotor coordination task, read our article here:<br>
