During my time at Queen's I collaborated with members from the Laboratory of Integrative Motor Behaviour (LIMB) run by Dr. Stephen Scott. Our paper  <i>Rapid eye and hand responses in an interception task are differentially modulated by context-dependent predictability</i> was just published in the Journal of Vision. I have written a little poem inspired by "Green Eggs and Ham" by Dr. Seuss.

I am sure. Sure I am. <br/>
That sure I am! That sure I am!  <br/>
I do not know that sure I am. <br/> 

So would you like fast eyes and hands? <br/>
I do not know fast eyes and hands. <br/>

Would you, could you hit fast balls? <br/>
I do not know fast balls that fall.
I do not know fast balls at all. <br/>
I do not know how fast I am. <br/>
I do not know fast eyes and hands. <br/>

Could you hit fast balls that jumped? <br/>
I am sure, if sure I am, <br/>
I could hit fast balls that jumped. <br/>
I could hit them with fast hands. <br/>
I could see them with fast eyes. <br/>
I could hit them here or there, <br/>
I could hit them anywhere. <br/>

Could you hit fast balls that fall? <br/>
I do not know, if balls will jump. <br/>
I do not know, if balls will fall. <br/>
If I am sure, I can hit them all. <br/>
If I am not sure, <br/>
I could not, would not hit the ball. <br/>
I do not have fast eyes and hands. <br/>
I could not hit them with fast hands. <br/>
I could not see them with fast eyes. <br/>
I could not hit them here or there, <br/>
I could not hit them anywhere. <br/>

Could you hit balls that jump up top? <br/>
If I saw them jump up top, <br/>
I could hit them without a drop. <br/>
I do not need fast hands to hit, <br/>
I do have my fast eyes for this. <br/>
I could hit them at this time. <br/>
I would hit fast balls just fine. <br/>

Could you hit balls that jump down low? <br/>
If I saw them jump down low, <br/>
I could not hit them in a row. <br/>
I do have my fast eyes for this. <br/>
I do have fast hands not to miss. <br/>
I could hit balls that jump down low. <br/>
If fast I move and not too slow. <br/>

So would you like fast eyes and hands? <br/>
I am sure. Sure I am. <br/>
I do like fast eyes and hands. <br/>
I like fast eyes to see balls jump. <br/>
I have fast eyes when I am sure. <br/>
I have fast eyes when balls jump high. <br/>
I have fast eyes when balls jump low. <br/>
I have fast eyes when I move slow. <br/>
Fast eyes are here, fast eyes are there. <br/>
My fast eyes are everywhere. <br/>

I am sure. Sure I am. <br/>
I do like fast eyes and hands. <br/>
I like fast hands to hit fast balls. <br/>
I have fast hands when I am sure. <br/>
I have fast hands when balls jump low. <br/>
For jumps up top, my hands are slow. <br/>
If fast balls are near, fast hands are here. <br/>
I do so like fast eyes and hands. <br/>
