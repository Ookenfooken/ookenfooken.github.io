During my time at Queen's I collaborated with Renato Moraes, a professor from Universidade de São Paulo, who was on sabbatical at the time. Our paper  <i>Microsaccadic modulation in goal-directed reaching</i> has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Vision special issue "Eye Movements as Windows to the Mind: The Integration of Eye Movements, Perception, Attention, and Cognition – Honoring the Contributions of Eileen Kowler". I have written a little poem inspired by "Oh, the Thinks You Can Think!" by Dr. Seuss.

Microsaccadic modulation in goal-directed reaching <br/>
By Dr. Foo’ss <br/>
------ <br/>
Oh, the thinks your eyes think!<br/>

They can think about dots,<br/>
they can think about tones, <br/>
they can think about spots,<br/>
they can think about zones,<br/>
they can think about touch,<br/>
they can think such and such.<br/>

They think and they slow,<br/>
the eyes start to snore,<br/>
they think and they slow,<br/>
microsaccades are no more.<br/>

When thinking about events,<br/>
the microsaccade rate dents.<br/>
The event will signal go,<br/>
the eyes think and slow.<br/>
When thinking about seeing,<br/>
the eyes become slower,<br/>
When thinking about reaching,<br/>
microsaccades are even lower.<br/>

The eyes think and think,<br/>
but they also can see.<br/>
They can see the go cue<br/>
that acts like a boo.<br/>
The cue, like a sneeze,<br/>
makes your eyes stop and freeze. <br/>
A stimulus reaction<br/>
different from abstraction.<br/>

Oh, the thinks your eyes think!<br/>
They can think about things.<br/>
Things that are moving,<br/>
the event of removing,<br/>
things that disappear,<br/>
a thing drawing near.<br/>
They can think about action.<br/>
The action of reaching.<br/>
The event of completing.<br/>
Actions that lead to a goal,<br/>
like reaching to a pole. <br/>

When thinking about action,<br/>
the eyes are still slow.<br/>
The act of protraction,<br/>
makes microsaccades low.<br/>
When thinking about things,<br/>
the eyes are so slow,<br/>
A target approaching and<br/>
the rate remains low.<br/>

Oh, the thinks your eyes think!<br/>
Your eyes think and reflect,<br/>
your eyes reflect anticipation,<br/>
your eyes think quite unchecked<br/>
about upcoming sensation,<br/>
about sensorimotor events,<br/>
as the microsaccade rate dents. <br/>
