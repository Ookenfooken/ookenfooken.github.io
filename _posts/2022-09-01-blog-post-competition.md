I am currently working on a DFG funded research project on <i>Gaze and motor control – Patterns of Coordination</i>. I have written a little poem inspired by "The Cat in the Hat" by Dr. Seuss.

Adaptive eye-hand coordination when manipulating and monitoring the environment in parallel <br/>
By Dr. Foo’ss <br/>
------ <br/>
I have some new findings. <br/>
I will show them to you. <br/>
I think you will not mind at all if I do. <br/> <br/>

I know some good science you could read. <br/>
Yes, I do. <br/>
A lot of good science that will fascinate you. <br/> <br/>

We look! <br/>
As we pick up a ball. <br/>
We look! <br/>
As we put down a ball. <br/>
It’s no problem at all! <br/>
As we pick up the ball <br/>
Our eyes shift ahead. <br/>
Our eyes lead the hand <br/>
There is no question yet. <br/> <br/>

I can pick up a ball. <br/>
I can do it a lot. <br/>
I can pick up a ball <br/>
And drop it into a slot. <br/>
My eyes like the ball <br/>
And my eyes like the slot <br/>
They shift back and forth <br/>
They do it a lot. <br/> <br/>

But that is not all! <br/>
Oh no. <br/>
That is not all… <br/>
I can pick up a tool to pick up the ball. <br/>
And I will look at the ball <br/>
As I lift it up tall. <br/>
I will not drop the ball, <br/>
No, I will not. <br/>
With my tool I can place the ball in the slot. <br/> <br/>

But that is not all! <br/>
Oh no. <br/>
That is not all… <br/>
I can pick up the ball <br/>
While I watch a display. <br/>
I can pick up the ball while my eyes are away. <br/>
As I watch the display <br/>
I can insert the ball. <br/>
But that is no fun. <br/>
Oh no. That is no fun. <br/>
It is no fun at all. <br/>
Before I insert the ball in the slot <br/>
My eyes like to see it. <br/>
Oh, they like it a lot. <br/> <br/>

But that is not all! <br/>
Oh no. <br/>
That is not all… <br/>
When I take the tool to pick up the ball. <br/>
Ho can I look at the display at all? <br/>
My eyes want to see how the tool grasps the ball. <br/>
My eyes want to see the display on the wall. <br/>
They compete! <br/>
The ball and the display. <br/>
They compete! <br/>
Oh, where should my eyes decide to stay? <br/>
I look! <br/>
At the ball and the slot. <br/>
I look! <br/>
At the display a lot. <br/>
But have no fear! <br/>
Have no fear at all. <br/>
I can figure it out <br/>
When to look at the ball. <br/> <br/>

Look! <br/>
There was a change on the display. <br/>
Surely now is the time to look somewhere else! <br/>
As I put the ball into the slot, <br/>
I learn some new things. <br/>
Oh, I learn a lot. <br/>
I learn to move my eyes and my hand <br/>
As the display keeps changing, I understand. <br/>
The world around me informs my perception a lot. <br/>
So, I have to decide when to act on the spot.
