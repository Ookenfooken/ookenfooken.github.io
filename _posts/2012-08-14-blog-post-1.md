We just submitted a mini-review on the role of eye movements during manual interception to Vision Research. This was a fun project that started as a neuroforum article and developed into a more comprehensive review.

Why are we interested?

To successfully catch a flying ball, we have to move our hands to the right place at the right time. During such goal-directed actions we rely on visual information to make accurate predictions about the moving object's motion path. In this review we discuss the role of eye movements during manual interception. Linking eye movements to interceptive hand movements ties together two lines of research: the continuous interaction between eye movements and vision (Gegenfurtner, 2016) and the important role of vision for interception (Brenner & Smeets, 2018; Zhao & Warren, 2015).
